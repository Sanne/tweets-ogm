First, I'd suggest to read the related blogpost first:
http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/WhatYouDidNotSeeAtTheJBossWorld2011KeynoteDemo

And see the recording of the demo we made in Boston 2011, at the JBoss World keynote:
http://www.jboss.org/jbw2011keynote.html

This is an example domain model mapped on HibernateOGM and using Hibernate Search
to provide the query functionalities needed for the Twitter demo, and approximately
represents the model used in the keynote presentation.

This domain model is what was planned to be used initially, and very similar to what
was used in practice; the final code is included in a more complex project integrating
all the parts which will be published later this month; the final code has no significantly
interesting changes compared to the initial plan, the single entity just contained some more
fields [TODO provide link to full code when it's published].

Consider it an example on how to configure Hibernate OGM, Infinispan, Hibernate Search,
the JBoss Transaction Manager and how queries could be implemented to load the required
statistics.

I think this is a pretty creative use of Lucene, taking advantage of it's inverted index
nature, and provides a far more efficient way to implement the required queries; also
as you can see coding the standard queries it was very simple, and the resulting scalability
is great.
